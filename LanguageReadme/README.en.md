To use this script for automating tasks in Discord, here’s a step-by-step guide based on the provided instructions:

---

### General Overview
The script interacts with Discord's internal APIs to automate completion of specific quest tasks. Common tasks include watching videos, playing games on desktop, streaming, or other supported activities. By running the script, users can simulate completing these tasks without doing them manually.

---

### Steps to Execute the Script

1. **Enable Developer Tools in Discord**:
   - Open Discord PTB or Canary.
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to open the developer tools.
   - Navigate to the **Console** tab.

2. **Bypass the Console Paste Warning**:
   - Discord displays a warning against pasting untrusted code into the Developer Console.
   - To allow pasting, type `allow pasting` in the console and press `Enter`.

3. **Paste the Script**:
   - Copy the provided script (from the code block above).
   - Paste the script into the Discord Developer Console.
   - Press `Enter` to execute it.

4. **View Task Progress in Real-Time**:
   - The console will log detailed progress on the completion of the active quests.
   - It displays the percentage completed, the remaining time, and the quest details.

5. **Receive Rewards**:
   - Once the tasks are completed, you can manually claim the rewards directly in Discord.

---

### Key Functionalities of the Script:
- **Task Detection**:
  Automatically identifies active quests/tasks that are not yet complete.

- **Supported Tasks**:
  Supports the following tasks:
  - `WATCH_VIDEO`
  - `PLAY_ON_DESKTOP`
  - `STREAM_ON_DESKTOP`
  - `PLAY_ACTIVITY`
  - `WATCH_VIDEO_ON_MOBILE`

- **Fakes Behavior**:
  - Spoofs activity such as watching videos, playing games, or streaming content to simulate task completion.
  - Uses Discord's internal APIs and events system (e.g., FluxDispatcher).

- **Progress Bar**:
  - Outputs a visual representation of task progress in the console.

- **Automated Rewards**:
  - Completes tasks and logs completion messages to guide the user.

---

### Important Notes and Precautions:
- **Internal API Usage**:
  The script uses Discord's unpublished internal APIs which might change at any time.

- **TOS Compliance**:
  Using automation scripts may violate Discord's **Terms of Service**. Use at your own risk.

- **Discord PTB/Canary**:
  The script might only work with specific Discord builds such as Discord PTB or Canary.

- **Review the Code**:
  Always review the script before pasting it into the console to ensure safe usage.

- **Disclaimer**:
  This script is intended for educational purposes.
